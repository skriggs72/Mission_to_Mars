# About

This is the personal project for unit 12 (Web-Scraping) of Data Visualization and Analytics.

Scrapes of various websites were done and the data was then placed into an application that would allow a user to scrape the data at the click of a button. The data would then be displayed on an website. The data that we pulled is the latest article from the website https://mars.nasa.gov/news/. A table of facts from the website https://space-facts.com/mars/ and from the website https://astrogeology.usgs.gov images of the 4 hemispheres of Mars.
